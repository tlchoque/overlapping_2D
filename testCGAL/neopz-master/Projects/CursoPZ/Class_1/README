PZ Class

Class 1:
Use of PZ vector and numerical integration packages.

Task 1:
Implement the integration rules for each master element of PZ
(linear, quad, triangle, hexahedra, prism, pyramid and tetrahedra).
For the integral evaluation use the given expression:
y = Alfa * x^r * y^s * z^t, where Alfa = Sin (n) and n a function of polynomial order p.

Solution

1.) Create an object of the type of the desired integration rule for the specified order p;
2.) Take the number of integration points for this rule and the respective weights;
3.) Evaluate the sum of function on each point multiplied by the respective weight.

You can verify the results using the mathematica in the repository.
