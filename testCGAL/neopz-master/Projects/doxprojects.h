 \page pg_app_projects DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION PROJECTS

 The applications using neoPZ environment are divided in three groups:
 
 \section app_hiperbolic The hiperbolic projects
 \subsection steam_injection - Steam Injection in Reservoir
 
 \subsection cons_law - Conservation Laws
 
 \section app_elliptic The elliptic projects
 
 \section app_parabolic The parabolic projects
 
 Also considerer a group for high performance (parallelism) and for hp-adaptive versions.
 
 \section app_highperform High performance
 
 \section app_adaptive hp-Adaptivity
